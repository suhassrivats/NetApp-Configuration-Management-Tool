# This project is to verify CMODE NetApp clusters using NetApp Manageablity SDK

This script will extract data of a CMODE cluster, convert it to JSON format, dump it into Elastic Search Database as JSON, query data from ES and verify it.

# Future Scope

I would like to turn this into a Configuration Management System, where we can monitor cluster's health in a Webpage.
